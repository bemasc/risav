Arrived packets that should be processed with RISAV would be failed to locate available SAs. Then this packet should be processed like a common packet that not be protected with an IPsec AH/ESP header. So do the source and destination ASBR. When the handshake is complete and running after a while one ACS's link failed, the peer ACS would detect the link is failed with the keepalive packets and remove or deprecate the relative SAs. The keepalive packet is defined in {{RFC3948}} while it is not in NAT traversal. After a grace period, the traffic will be recovered. But the failure should be reported to the administrator with the operations protocols. This would decrease the effect on inter-AS traffic.",

          "body": "My concern is principally related to downgrade attacks on RISAV.\r\n\r\nConsider an MITM attacker between the two ASes.  If this attacker simply drops all packets to the contact IPs, the attacker can prevent the two ASes from ever performing an IKE handshake.  In HTTPS, this would be similar to blocking port 443.  HTTPS simply \"fails hard\" in this case, to ensure that the attacker can only produce a DoS.  We could do the same, but I suspect AS operators would be concerned about the possibility of accidental outages, especially when the RISAV deployment is new.  However, if the ASes simply fall back to non-RISAV communication, then the attacker can disable RISAV.\r\n\r\nI think our best option is probably to add a boolean flag like `testing` to `RISAVAnnouncement`.  If this flag is true, it means that the operator does not guarantee the uptime of this ACS, so other ASes should fall back to non-RISAV.  Then each AS can decide whether its own RISAV implementation is stable enough to remove the fallback.\r\n\r\nI agree that failures should be reported to the administrator, even in testing mode, so that AS operators can tell whether RISAV is working correctly.",

However, a timeout interval may be also enough.\r\n\r\nThe IKEv2 has such an authenticated permanent rejection option that would help the IKE nodes to reject connections quickly. But, when an IKE node is down or unfortunately crashed, i.e. in an abnormal case, how it can send out such an option? And in a normal case, RISAV maybe not care about the disabling time.

That is because the `testing` field may be set to `true`. At that time, the ACS is not fully reliable. When ACS is down, the SA generation may also fail before ACS reboots. So how to roll back to ordinary operation is a question.\r\n\r\nI think we can design a `green channel` that will be used between two ACSes. In this channel, only the contact IP will not be checked with the RISAV header. That means the communication between the contact IP is always in the ordinary way when the `green channel` is working. But this seems to be infeasible in tunnel mode as the tunnel is built with the contact IP.\r\n",

On another point, multiple contact IPs could shrink the IKE negotiation time but the collaboration of the IKE parties and the division of the IKE parties that one IKE node should keep in touch with are also complex tasks. In the long run, multiple contact IPs should be an important agenda for RISAV.\r\nThe full deployment of RISAV requires one deployer should keep in touch with almost all deployers which are a number of ASes, but a paper published at IMC15: [Are We One Hop Away from a Better Internet?](https://conferences2.sigcomm.org/imc/2015/papers/p523.pdf) shows that the average AS path to access Internet content is about 3.5 hops. Thus I think the IKE connection size should not be too large. So the multiple contact IPs may not be the first thing we should think about now.

Each network chooses a \"minimum intended end-to-end MTU\" (`minMTU`), which must be at least 1280.\r\n2. Consider two ASes, **A** and **B**.  Suppose **A** is about to initiate an IKEv2 handshake to **B** (**A** is client, **B** is server).\r\n3. First, **A** checks its Path MTU to **B**.  If this is not known \"a priori\", **A** MUST measure it, and MAY do so using PMTUD on the path from `ACS_A` to `ACS_B`.  We call this value `MTU[A->B]`.\r\n4. If `MTU[A->B] - 24 >= minMTU[A]`, **A** can offer RISAV to B in transport mode.  If `MTU[A->B] - 73 >= minMTU[A]`, it can also offer tunnel mode.\r\n5. When **B** receives an IKEv2 CHILD_SA_INIT message, it performs the same check from its perspective, using `MTU[B->A]`.  It accepts only SAs that are compatible with `minMTU[B]`, and rejects the others.  If none are allowable, they are all rejected.\r\n6. The inter-AS MTU value is sent to all ASBRs as part of the SA, and used as the initial PMTU estimate.\r\n7. If an ASBR receives an ICMP Packet Too Big response whose echoed (i.e. inner) header matches the SA, it adjusts (i.e. reduces) its local MTU estimate.\r\n8. If an ASBR's local MTU falls below `minMTU`, it should inform the ACS.  The ACS can then reduce its estimate of `MTU[X->Y]` and use IKEv2 to [terminate this SA](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7296#section-1.4.1) if that value is too small.\r\n9. (OPTIONAL?) The ASBR applies [TCP MSS clamping](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO/lartc.cookbook.mtu-mss.html) based on the current estimate inner MTU.\r\n\r\nIn transport mode, ICMP Packet Too Big responses are forwarded through the ASBR, stripping the echoed RISAV-AH header.  This allows PMTUD to work as usual for the endpoints.\r\n\r\nIn tunnel mode, each ASBR maintains a PMTU estimate for each SA, which is initialized to the `MTU[X->Y]` value used during the handshake.  Packets exceeding this size are dropped and produce a Packet Too Big response from the ASBR.  If the ASBR receives a Packet Too Big response for its own IPsec packets, it reduces its local MTU estimate for this SA.  (This can happen if the initial MTU estimate is wrong for this path, or the path MTU changes.)  ASBRs MAY also run their own PMTUD for their SAs.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement ensures that AS pairs with a consistent inter-AS MTU never reduce the end-to-end MTU below the value that is intended by either AS.  If the MTU is variable or heterogeneous, this arrangement ensures that PMTUD continues to work correctly for endpoints.  If the MTU on any path falls below the required minimum, RISAV will be disabled within ~1 second.  The addition of MSS clamping ensures that non-PMTUD-capable TCP clients don't attempt to use large packets that will not work.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMy biggest concern about this approach is that it enables some downgrade attacks:\r\n\r\nA. A transit provider could simply reduce the actual MTU to 1280 in order to cause RISAV to be disabled automatically.\r\nB. An off-path attacker could send a Packet Too Big response that contains a packet from the other AS.\r\n\r\nAttack A is probably acceptable for now (i.e. out of scope).  Attack B is more concerning, and I'm not sure how to mitigate it.",

During normal PMTUD, PTB forgery is prevented by the entropy of the original packet, which must be echoed in the response.  If the PTB message doesn't match a packet that was recently sent, it is ignored.  The ASBR cannot apply this defense, because it has no memory of the packet that was sent (which may not have even passed through this ASBR, if ECMP clustering or multicore implementation is in use).\r\n\r\nMaybe a better solution is to say: if an ASBR receives a PTB response indicating a PMTU that is less than the current MTU estimate, it performs its own explicit PMTUD.  This is not vulnerable to off-path attacks.  However, it is somewhat unusual: we want the \"inter-AS\" PMTU, without regard to the packet handling inside the target AS.  Therefore, the measurement proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The sending ASBR runs a traceroute to the target IP listed in the PTB response.

RISAV is a controversial new usage of AH, but they recommend using ESP-NULL, an no encryption version of ESP.\r\n2. **TE for ESP/Tunnel mode**. There is no difference among different packets in `source IP` and `destination IP` in the tunnel mode of RISAV, the TE may be failed.\r\n3. **MOAS**. Multiple-Origin AS.\r\n4. **DoS defence**. A convincing background may be needed. DoS attack is not a good choice. Normal traffic whose source address is not spoofing could also be composed of DoS traffic. I think the classification of harm of lacking SAV in RFC 5210 is more convincing.\r\n5. **New collaborator and maybe new drafts**. As [Russ Housley](mailto:housley@vigilsec.com) wants to be a collaborator, I have no problem with that and quite welcome. And I think we could also let the `RISAVAnnouncement` be a general one. Because it not only can be used in RISAV but also could be used in other approaches that need one entity representing the whole AS. And for this reason, we may need to write another draft. As Nan Geng said, it can go to `sidrops` WG.\r\n6. **ISPs' deployment expectation**. So far, we have communicated with some major ISPs in China. China Telecom (CT for abbrev.) has shown great interest in RISAV. And for tag-based SAV approaches, CT would deploy a demo based on IPv6 in the recent future. The demo is not RISAV-driven but IPv6-driven, whose tag would be encapsulated in the IPv6 Destination extension header.",

We need to enrich the introduction of RPKI in RISAV**\r\n\r\nMOAS is the question of prefix hijacking of BGP. I have learned that MOAS occurs because BGP cannot validate the authenticity and integrity of routing information. So route information is vulnerable to prefix hijacking though MOAS is legal in some cases including static or IGP route in Fig.1 and using private ASN in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42705918/233816026-d1c386f5-3635-43ec-89eb-41bf066b99d0.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42705918/233816031-2cc64409-d35e-4492-8948-9c9d22f9c607.png)\r\n\r\nAs defined in [Sec. 7 of RFC 1930](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1930#section-7), one prefix should belong to one AS, and there would be no MOAS problem if the recommendation is followed.\r\n\r\nRISAV uses RPKI which binds the ASN and IP prefixes with ROA, as defined in [RFC 6482](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6482/). RISAV SHOULD NOT change the route or modify BGP. The relationship between RPKI and RISAV, I think, is that RPKI is the prerequisite of RISAV, i.e., the trust anchor of RISAV is RPKI. Maybe the deployment of RISAV would foster the deployment of RPKI in the future.\r\n\r\nSo we don't need to discuss MOAS in RISAV. We just need to enrich the introduction of the usage of RPKI in RISAV in my view. The basic is that the status of ROA in use should be not `INVALID` or `UNKNOWN` but `VALID`.",

Shall we remove the Transport mode and use Tunnel mode only? Or just leave it as it is?\r\n\r\nMaybe we could replace AH with ESP-NULL in transport mode. But ESP-NULL MAY not be the proper answer and there is no reserved field to distinguish standard IPsec ESP-NULL and RISAV-ESP-NULL as RISAV-AH does.\r\n\r\nESP-NULL contains NULL encryption and NULL integrity, which cannot be both NULL, as defined in Sec. 5 of RFC 4303. Generally, it is NULL encryption here. Therefore the existence of ESP-NULL makes AH awkward. However, what makes AH different is the range of authentication data. AH authenticates some constant fields of the IP header which are omitted in ESP.\r\n\r\nI think it is better to reserve it here. But it disobeys the discussion in #27.  Maybe we need to adopt your third piece of advice.",

In addition, there is usually a filename convention that give a filename extension for use in the RPKI repository.\r\n\r\nI strongly encourage you to prohibit the use of inherit in IPAddressChoice.  In SIDRops, we are trying to avoid the need to look into the certification path to get the list of addresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestions for the ASN.1 follow:\r\n\r\nFirst, it is very helpful to provide a full ASN.1 module.  This avoids confusion about IMPLICIT tagging and EXPLICIT tagging, which can lead to interoperability problems when two implementers made different assumptions.\r\n\r\nSecond, I suggest providing the bounds on ASID that limit the values to possible AS numbers.\r\n\r\nThird, I think contactIP should allow a SEQUENCE OF one or two IPAddressFamily items.  Currently, it requires two.  I think you want to allow IPv4, IPv6, or both.\r\n\r\nFourth, I suggest that testing have a DEFAULT value of FALSE.

SAVI used to be a thing. It had a bunch of downsides. Do those problems apply here?\r\n4. David Schinazi: Talk to the operators, and see what they think.\r\n5. Alex Chernyakhovsky: I think this problem is poorly defined. Users in the deployed AS do not get benefits from it. I don\u2019t think the added encryption is better than the MASQUE tunnel of tunnels.\r\n6. Ted Hardie: If you\u2019re saying only customers large enough to be ISPs can use this, then it\u2019s a very different problem space. I don\u2019t think the use case is written out quite right. For dispatch, go to NANOG or go to ARIN policy list.\r\n7. John Scudder: I\u2019m concerned about deploying this at scale between ASs. The volume of traffic passing between ASs is orders of magnitude greater than in site-to-site IPsec. Also people would not be able to opt into this process.\r\n8.

In the absence\r\n>    of negotiation (or manual configuration) of an anti-replay mechanism\r\n>    for such an SA, it is recommended that sender and receiver checking\r\n>    of the Sequence Number for the SA be disabled\r\n\r\nThis is because the different senders will have different sequence numbers, but the receiver has no way to distinguish the different senders.  This is why I've removed the sequence number entirely from the RISAV-AH header.\r\n\r\nIn Tunnel Mode, the different ASBRs are instructed to use distinct source IPs for RISAV.

For example, if one AS is forced to reset its ACS and ASBRs, it may lose the private keys for all active RISAV SAs.  If RISAV were applied to the IKEv2 traffic used for bootstrapping, the participating ASes would be unable to communicate until these broken SAs expire, likely after multiple hours or days.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that RISAV participants can rapidly recover from this error state, RISAV places control plane traffic in a \"green tunnel\" that is exempt from RISAV's protections.  This \"tunnel\" is defined by two requirements:\r\n\r\n* RISAV senders MUST NOT add RISAV protection to packets to or from any announced contact IP\r\n* RISAV recipients MUST NOT enforce RISAV validation on packets sent to or from any announced contact IP.\r\n\r\nAlthough the green tunnel denies RISAV protection to the ACS, the additional mitigations described in {data-plane} ensure that the ACS is nonetheless strongly protected against address-spoofing and DDoS attacks.\r\n```\r\n\r\nApart from phrasing, the only difference here is that I have omitted the discussion of disabling the green tunnel.

It seems the following description in section {data-plane} can not prevent such a spoofing scenario that Attacker `A` uses the contact IP of `S` as its source address and sends the packet to `D`.\r\n\r\nIn this case, if ASBR of `D` does not inspect but removes the RISAV header, this packet is sent to the ACS of `D`. I don't know if it is possible to prevent the end hosts, not ACS, in one participating AS from sending such packets. If the operator could close the green channel manually, the above scenario may disappear as the ASBR of `D` would inspect the RISAV header of incoming packets.\r\n\r\nSo I think it is better to close the green channel if the communication is stable. There may be some subtle details that bother us, for instance, it could not be able to enable/disable the green channel automatically and smartly.\r\n\r\n> To avoid DoS attacks, participating ASes MUST drop any outgoing packet to the contact IP of another AS. Only the AS operator's systems (i.e. the ACS and ASBRs) are permitted to send packets to the contact IPs of other ASes. ASBRs MAY drop inbound packets to the contact IP from non-participating ASes.",
